# Log-GPIS demo
This repository contains a demo code showing the basic idea of our paper **Faithful Euclidean Distance Field from Log-Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces**, which is submitted to RA-L 2021.

## 2D demo
The observation is a circle to show our Log-GPIS in a 2D case.

## 3D demo
The observation is a sphere to show our Log-GPIS in a 3D case.
